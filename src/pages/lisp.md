The Lisp Language Family has begotten some of the most interesting programming languages that are
currently around.  Three of them are

  1. [Common Lisp][CL], though quite old, still offers a lot innovative concepts most other
  languages don't have.

  2. [Guile Scheme][guile], the GNU Scripting Language, offers a very modern dialect of
  [Scheme][scheme] with a lot of additional libraries, macros, delimited continuations and an
  interface to C.

  3. [Clojure][clojure], a dialect of Lisp running on the JVM with built in support for lazy
  sequences.
