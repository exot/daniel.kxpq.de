I am a scholarship holder of the Research Training Group
[QuantLA](http://lat.inf.tu-dresden.de/quantla) under supervision of
[Prof. Bernhard Ganter](http://tu-dresden.de/Members/bernhard.ganter/),
[Prof. Franz Baader](http://lat.inf.tu-dresden.de/~baader/index-en.html) and
[Prof. Gerd Brewka](http://www.informatik.uni-leipzig.de/~brewka/).  My PhD thesis is
about [Formal Concept Analysis](/math/fca/) and [Description Logics](http://dl.kr.org) and
may also involve some research on non-monotonic logics.

I like programming, math (calculus and algebra), computer science, Linux, Unix,
[GNU](http://www.gnu.org) and Open Source Software in general.  Apart from this, expressionistic
literature, [modern poetry](/poems/), buddhism and japanese animated cartoons from
[Hayao Miyazaki](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hayao_Miyazaki) are of my interest.  I also like to
play [Go](http://sensei.xmp.net).
  
Here are my public keys, for if you want to securely communicate with me.  I use the
[main public key](/pub/public.key) only from my personal computers, so it can be regarded as more
secure, however reply times might be longer.  Use the [external public key](/pub/extern-public.key)
if this is a problem.
