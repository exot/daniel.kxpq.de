My name is Daniel Borchmann and I'm a PhD math student at the [Technische Universität Dresden][TUD]
under supervision of [Prof. Bernhard Ganter][Bernhard].  The main focus of my work lies on
[Formal Concept Analysis](/math/fca/) with special treatment of Association Rules and connections to

### Personal Quirks

I like programming, math (calculus and algebra), computer science, Linux, Unix,
[GNU](http://www.gnu.org) and Open Source Software in general.  Apart from this, expressionistic
literature, [modern poetry](/poems/), buddhism and japanese animated cartoons from
[Hayao Miyazaki](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hayao_Miyazaki) are of my interest.  I also like to
play [Go](http://sensei.xmp.net).

Things I don't like include Aldi, Lidl, Kik, Coca Cola, Nestlé and others.  Besides that,
intransigence, laziness, unfairness, disrespect for life and dishonesty are things I could get very
upset about.  Yes, I'm an idealist.
  
If you want to securely communicate with me, for if you want to securely communicate with me.  I use
the [main public key](/pub/public.key) only from my personal computers, so it can be regarded as
more secure, however reply times might be longer.  Use the
[external public key](/pub/extern-public.key) if this is a problem.
