## Formal Concept Analysis

Formal Concept Analysis (FCA) is a mathematical theory developed in the early eighties to
restructure lattice theory by Prof. Rudolf Wille at the TU Darmstadt.  Since then, it has developed
into a powerful theory for conceptual structuring and knowledge acquisition, with connections to
other knowledge representation formalisms like Description Logics.
