Random thoughts are creeping around in my mind, and sometimes it is necessary to free my head from
them.  Here you can find the results.  They are not meant as absolute truth.  They are just my
random thoughts.

: This essay discusses an more or less formal definition of *pragmatic power* of programming
  languages and tries to connect this notion to the success of programming languages.

[Maintaining Understandability](pensieve/maintaining-understandability)
: Maintaining code is one of the core aspects of programming.  This essays tries to connect
  maintainability of code to the pragmatic power of the programming language used.
