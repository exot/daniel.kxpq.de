# Daniel's Pensieve

Random thoughts are creeping around in my mind, and sometimes it is necessary to free my head from
them.  Here you can find the results.  They are not meant as absolute truth.  They are just my
random thoughts.

[On the Pragmatic Power of Programming Languages](pensieve/pragmatic-power)
: This essay discusses an more or less formal definition of *pragmatic power* of programming
  languages and tries to connect this notion to the success of programming languages.

[Maintaining Understandability](pensieve/maintaining-understandability)
: Maintaining code is one of the core aspects of programming.  This essays tries to connect
  maintainability of code to the pragmatic power of the programming language used.

Other things I sometimes think about include

The Curse of Lisp
: Lisp is a wunderful programming language, capable of doing things only very few other languages
  can do (and then only very clumsy).  However, once one has got the main idea of Lisp, it is quite
  hard to work in other languages since one always has the impression that one is not doing it the
  way one wants to do it.  Can this be avoided?  Is it a problem at all or are Lisp programmers only
  weepy academics who like to have the world full of paranetheses?
  
Don't Invent Data
: In the field of Data Mining it is often the case that new algorithms are presented on small
  examples to show their usefulness.  However, most often those examples are so artificial that one
  hardly believes that *any* algorithms is even necessary to examine it.  And artificial example can
  never show the usefulness of a new algorithm when applied to real data.  That sounds much too
  obvious to be generally accepted.  Always follow the rule of *Don't Invent Data*!
  
Ubiquitous Distraction
: When walking along the street one can constantly see people listing to music, playing with their
  mobiles or hacking their laptops.  In essentially every aspect of life computers are now present
  and deliver constrant distraction from the old reality.  Is this good?  Aren't we overlooking
  something?  Do we create a new world of virtuality that is in no need anymore for the plain old
  world?  Is it more strange to walk while watching a video on a mobile phone than to listen to a
  small bird singing?

Luckily, some people had thoughts I could have had before me, and moreover were able to express them
in a way I never could have done.
