Mathematical things I'm interested in include

 * Algebraic Graph Theory
 * Algebraic Number Theory
 * Group Theory
 * Formal Concept Analysis
 * [Mathematical Voting Theory](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voting_theory)
 * Mathematical Logic
 * Game Theory
 
This doesn't mean, however, that I'm an expert in any of these fields.

For FCA, I've also written a [small program](http://github.com/exot/conexp-clj/) that can
automate computations.
