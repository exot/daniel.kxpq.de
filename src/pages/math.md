I'm employed by the [Insitute of Algebra](http://www.math.tu-dresden.de/alg) of the
[TU Dresden](http://tu-dresden.de).  Ocassionaly I'm also organizing exercises.  For further
information on that, you may also want at my
[official math homepage](http://www.math.tu-dresden.de/~borch/math/) (in german only).

Personally, one of the mathematical fields I'm mostly interested in is
[Formal Concept Analysis](/math/fca/).
