I'm employed by the [Insitute of Algebra](http://www.math.tu-dresden.de/alg) of the
[TU Dresden](http://tu-dresden.de).  Ocassionaly I'm also organizing exercises.  For further
information on that, you may also want at my
[official math homepage](http://www.math.tu-dresden.de/~borch/math/) (in german only).

Mathematical things I'm interested in include

 * Algebraic Graph Theory
 * Algebraic Number Theory
 * Group Theory
 * [Mathematical Voting Theory](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voting_theory)
 * [Formal Concept Analysis](/math/fca/)
 * Game Theory
 
This doesn't mean, however, that I'm an expert in any of these fields.

For FCA, I've also writte a [small program](/math/conexp-clj/) that can automate computations.
